# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Java-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the current standard for quantifying color differences in a way that best matches human vision.

This reference **Java** implementation offers an easy way to calculate these differences accurately within programs.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code (Java, released March 1, 2025) is available [here](../../ciede-2000.java#L6) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.java).

This classic source code can easily be integrated into a Processing sketch.

## Example usage in Java

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```java
// Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Java

// Color 1: l1 = 6.3    a1 = 39.4   b1 = 3.6
// Color 2: l2 = 6.5    a2 = 33.4   b2 = -2.0

double deltaE = ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2);
System.out.println(deltaE);

// .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 3.9368581959
// As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 3.9368724643
```

**Note** : L\* is generally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* typically between -128 and +127.

To compare **hexadecimal** (e.g., "#FFF") or **RGB colors** using the CIEDE2000 function, follow these examples :
- [compare-hex-colors.java](compare-hex-colors.java#L192)
- [compare-rgb-colors.java](compare-rgb-colors.java#L192)

## Verification

[![Java CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-java.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-java.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Java**, like this :

1. `command -v javac > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install default-jdk ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `cp -p tests/java/ciede-2000-driver.java Main.java`
4. `javac Main.java`
5. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
6. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
7. `java Main test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.java](ciede-2000-driver.java#L91) for calculations and [test-java.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-java.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :

### Comparison with The OpenIMAJ

[![ŒîE2000 against OpenIMAJ in Java](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-openimaj.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-openimaj.yml)

Compared to the well-established **OpenIMAJ** library ‚Äî first released in 2011 and still widely used 14 years later ‚Äî this ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> function, checked on billions of random L\*a\*b\* color pairs, has an absolute deviation of no more than **3 √ó 10<sup>-13</sup>**. As before in [C99](../c#comparison-with-the-vmaf-c99-library), [JavaScript](../js#comparison-with-the-npmchroma-js-library), [Python](../py#comparison-with-the-python-colormath-library) and  [Rust](../rs#comparison-with-the-palette-library), this confirms the interoperability of this colorimetry algorithm in Java, including with the award-winning one from the University of Southampton.

### Comparison with OpenJDK

[![ŒîE2000 against OpenJDK in Java](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-openjdk.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-openjdk.yml)

Compared to the most widely redistributed implementation of this algorithm in Java, **OpenJDK**‚Äôs, this public domain ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> function, checked on billions of random L\*a\*b\* color pairs, has an absolute deviation of no more than **3 √ó 10<sup>-13</sup>**. By default, without any modification, matching with this well-considered implementation is guaranteed with a tolerance of **3 √ó 10<sup>-4</sup>** in ŒîE2000 results. However, to get the same ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> results as OpenJDK given a tolerance of less than **10<sup>-12</sup>**, do what‚Äôs explained [here](../../ciede-2000.java#L34) in the source code, as follows :

```diff
-	h_m += Math.PI;
+	h_m += h_m < Math.PI ? Math.PI : -Math.PI;
```

> These are the two main variants for implementing the ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> function. The default is simpler, accurate enough, and widely used in practice. This formula, "small" in size, is an essential pillar of color management, deserving of this rigorous, tested and reliable industrial treatment.
