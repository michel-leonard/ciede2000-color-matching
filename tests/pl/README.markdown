# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Perl-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the best method for accurately quantifying color differences as perceived by the human eye.

This reference implementation in **Perl** offers a simple way of calculating these differences accurately and within scripts.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code (released March 1, 2025) is available [here](../../ciede-2000.pl#L10) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.pl).

## Example usage in Perl

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```pl
# Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Perl

# Color 1: L1 = 97.9   a1 = 28.2   b1 = 3.0
# Color 2: L2 = 98.4   a2 = 22.0   b2 = -2.1

my $deltaE = ciede_2000($L1, $a1, $b1, $L2, $a2, $b2);
print $deltaE;

# .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 4.4744286885
# As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 4.4744462960
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* typically between -128 and +127.

## Verification

[![Perl CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-pl.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-pl.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Perl**, like this :

1. `command -v perl > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install perl ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
4. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
5. `perl tests/pl/ciede-2000-driver.pl test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.pl](ciede-2000-driver.pl#L91) for calculations and [test-pl.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-pl.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
