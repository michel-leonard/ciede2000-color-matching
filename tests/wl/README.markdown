# ΔE2000 — Accurate. Fast. Mathematica-powered.

A precise **Mathematica** implementation of the CIEDE2000 formula - today’s standard for quantifying color differences.

The developed algorithm enables us to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, 🔵 navy blue and 🟡 yellow, which are very different colors, have a ΔE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full **Mathematica** source code released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.wl#L6) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.wl).

This function operates only on 64-bit floating-point numbers (`Real` type), and works in `MachinePrecision`.

## Example usage in Mathematica (Wolfram Language)

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede2000` function :

```mathematica
(* Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two Lab colors in Mathematica

Color 1: l1 = 77.6   a1 = 50.3   b1 = 2.4
Color 2: l2 = 78.3   a2 = 56.0   b2 = -2.5 *)

deltaE = ciede2000[l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2];
Print[deltaE];

(* .................................................. This shows a ΔE2000 of 2.9599647256
   As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 2.9599515492 *)
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* typically between -128 and +127.

For color inputs in **hexadecimal** (e.g., `#FFF`) or **RGB** formats, see examples for other languages :

## Verification

This implementation of the ΔE2000 function in Mathematica was tested on my local machine, and does not benefit, like other programming languages, from an automated testing workflow on GitHub Actions (because it’s a proprietary language). The [ciede-2000-driver.wl](ciede-2000-driver.wl#L92) file is provided in this directory so that you can perform similar tests yourself by processing a CSV file. Here’s a step-by-step guide to my tests :

- Installation of **GCC** : `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
- Driver compiled in **C99** : `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -Ofast -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
- Generates 3 GB of **L\*a\*b\* test colors** in CSV format : `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 100000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
- Use **wolframscript** : `wolframscript -file tests/wl/ciede-2000-driver.wl test-cases.csv | ciede-2000-driver`

When the 100,000,000 calculated color differences had been verified, the test ended and the C driver displayed :

```

```

Confirming that the `ciede2000` function complies with the standard, with zero errors and negligible floating-point deviations.

> To correct this Mathematica source code to exact match certain third-party ΔE2000 functions, follow the comments in the source code.

> This formula, "small" in size, is an essential pillar of color management, deserving of this rigorous, tested and reliable industrial treatment.

## Performance & Environment

The function can benefit from `Compile` with `CompilationTarget -> "C"` to speed up processing; this has been tried with success.

The environment in which the `ciede2000` function was tested is :
- Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
- WolframScript 1.13
- Wolfram Language 14.2.1
- GCC 13.3
