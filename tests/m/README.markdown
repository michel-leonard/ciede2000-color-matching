# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. MATLAB-powered.

This reference vectorized implementation of ŒîE2000 written in **MATLAB** enables reliable and precise calculation of color differences.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code, last updated on March 1, 2025, can be viewed [here](../../ciede-2000.m#L12) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.m).


## Example usage in MATLAB

Two methods of calling the ŒîE<sub>00</sub> function are provided :
- `ciede_2000_classic` accepts six floating-point scalars representing two individual colors in L\*a\*b\* space.
- `ciede_2000` accepts vectors of color components for batch processing multiple color pairs simultaneously.

A simple **Delta E 2000** calculation between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000_classic` function :

```matlab
% Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in MATLAB
% Color 1: L1 = 28.9, a1 = 47.5, b1 = 2.0
% Color 2: L2 = 28.8, a2 = 41.6, b2 = -1.7

deltaE = ciede_2000_classic(L1, a1, b1, L2, a2, b2);
disp(deltaE);

% .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 2.7749016764
% As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 2.7749152801
```

**Notes** :
- L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* typically between -128 and +127.
- The `ciede_2000` function is vectorized, requiring about 128 bytes of RAM for each pair of colors contained in the vectors.

## Verification

[![Matlab CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-m.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-m.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Matlab**, like this :

1. `command -v octave > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install octave ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `cp -p tests/m/ciede-2000-driver.m main.m`
4. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
5. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
6. `octave --quiet --eval 'main("test-cases.csv")'  | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.m](ciede-2000-driver.m#L12) for calculations and [test-m.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-m.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :

### Comparison with WagenaarLab

[![ŒîE2000 against Caltech in Matlab](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-caltech.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-caltech.yml)

Compared to the well-maintained **WagenaarLab** implementation ‚Äî first released in 2017 ‚Äî this ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> function, tested on millions of random L\*a\*b\* color pairs, has an absolute deviation of no more than **3 √ó 10<sup>-13</sup>**. As before in [C99](../c#comparison-with-the-vmaf-c99-library), [Java](../java#comparison-with-the-openimaj), [JavaScript](../js#comparison-with-the-npmchroma-js-library), [Python](../py#comparison-with-the-python-colormath-library) and  [Rust](../rs#comparison-with-the-palette-library), this confirms the **production-ready** status of the `ciede_2000` function, which is interoperable with the California Institute of Technology function in Matlab.

### Comparison with Gaurav Sharma‚Äôs calculations

[![ŒîE2000 against Gaurav Sharma in Matlab](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-sharma.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-sharma.yml)

Compared to the most accepted academic reference for this algorithm, that of **Gaurav Sharma** ‚Äî published in 2005 ‚Äî this ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> function, tested on billions of random L\*a\*b\* color pairs, has an absolute deviation of no more than **3 √ó 10<sup>-13</sup>**. By default, without any modification, matching with this canonical implementation is guaranteed with a tolerance of **3 √ó 10<sup>-4</sup>** in ŒîE2000 results. However, to get the same ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> results as [Gaurav Sharma](https://hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/gsharma/ciede2000)‚Äôs original algorithm given a tolerance of less than **10<sup>-12</sup>**, do what‚Äôs explained [here](../../ciede-2000.m#L45) in the source code, as follows :

```diff
-	h_m(mask) = h_m(mask) + pi;
+	h_m(mask) = h_m(mask) + ((h_m < pi) - (pi <= h_m)) * pi;
```

> These are the two main variants for implementing the ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> function. The default is simpler, accurate enough, and widely used in practice. This formula, "small" in size, is an essential pillar of color management, deserving of this rigorous, tested and reliable industrial treatment.
