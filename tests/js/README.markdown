# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. JavaScript-powered.

CIE 2000 is the current industry standard for quantifying color differences in a way that best matches human vision.

This reference **JavaScript** implementation offers an easy way to calculate these differences accurately within scripts.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The complete source code, released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.js#L6) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.js).

This reference implementation integrates seamlessly with [TypeScript](../ts#Œ¥e2000--accurate-fast-typescript-powered), Node.js, and Deno environments.

## Example usage in JavaScript

To calculate the **Delta E 2000** difference between two colors expressed in the **L\*a\*b\* color space**, use the `ciede_2000` function :

```javascript
// Define color 1 in L*a*b* space
const l1 = 43.2, a1 = 31.2, b1 = 4.1;

// Define color 2 in L*a*b* space
const l2 = 43.0, a2 = 35.5, b2 = -4.3;

// Calculate ŒîE2000 color difference
const deltaE = ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2);
console.log(deltaE);

// .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 5.2895865658
// As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 5.2895721943
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* generally between -128 and +127.

### üé® Flexibility

To compare **hexadecimal** (e.g., `#FFF`) or **RGB colors** using the CIEDE2000 function, see these example scripts :
- [compare-hex-colors.js](compare-hex-colors.js#L181)
- [compare-rgb-colors.js](compare-rgb-colors.js#L181)

The [all-in-one](../../#rgb-and-hexadecimal-color-comparison-for-the-web-in-javascript) function supports both RGB and hexadecimal formats, allowing quick color difference calculations using the D65 illuminant.

## Verification

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by JavaScript**, like this :

1. `command -v node > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nodejs ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
4. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
5. `node tests/js/ciede-2000-driver.js test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.js](ciede-2000-driver.js#L86) for calculations and [test-js.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-js.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :

Compared to the well-established **chroma-js** library on npm ‚Äî first published in 2011 and still widely used 14 years later ‚Äî this ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> function, validated on billions of random L\*a\*b\* color pairs, has an absolute deviation of no more than **5 √ó 10<sup>-13</sup>**. As previously in [C99](../c#comparison-with-the-vmaf-c99-library) and [Python](../py#comparison-with-the-python-colormath-library), this once again confirms the accuracy and numerical stability of this advanced colorimetry algorithm.

### Comparison with the npm/delta-e Library

Compared to the well-maintained **delta-e** library on npm ‚Äî first published in 2014 and still widely used 11 years later ‚Äî this implementation of the ŒîE2000 color difference formula, validated on billions of random L\*a\*b\* color pairs, has an absolute deviation of no more than **5 √ó 10<sup>-13</sup>**. This test confirms the general interoperability of the `ciede_2000` function in JavaScript, as well as its **production-ready** status.
