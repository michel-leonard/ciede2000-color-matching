	# - Three columns for the random sample L*a*b* color
	# - And the seventh column for the precise Delta E 2000 color difference between the standard and sample
	# The output will be correct, this can be verified :
	# - With the C driver, which provides a dedicated verification feature
	# - By using the JavaScript validator at https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching
