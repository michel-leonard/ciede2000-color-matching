# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. C++-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the current standard for quantifying color differences in a way that best matches human vision.

This reference implementation in **C++** provides a fast, accurate and generic function for calculating the correct distances between colors.

## Overview

This algorithm enables software to compare colors with scientific precision.

For reference :
- ŒîE<sub>00</sub> > 12 ‚Üí colors are visually very distinct.
- Lower values indicate greater similarity.

This is the most advanced method today for assessing color difference.

## Implementation Details

The full source code, released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.cpp#L14) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.cpp) for long-term reference.

This classic **templated** implementation of ŒîE<sub>00</sub> supports both **32-bit** single-precision and **64-bit** double-precision computations.

For simpler integration or legacy systems, [C-style](../c#Œ¥e2000--accurate-fast-c-powered) versions are also provided.

## Example usage in C++

A typical **Delta E 2000** calculation between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```cpp
// Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in C++
// L1 = 75.5        a1 = 22.5        b1 = -2.5
// L2 = 76.5        a2 = 16.5        b2 = 2.25

const auto delta_e_32_bits = ciede_2000<float>(L1, a1, b1, L2, a2, b2);
const auto delta_e_64_bits = ciede_2000<double>(L1, a1, b1, L2, a2, b2);

std::printf("DeltaE 2000 (float):  %.8g\n", delta_e_32_bits);
std::printf("DeltaE 2000 (double): %.8g\n", delta_e_64_bits);

// .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 4.8786078559
// As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 4.8785929856
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* typically between -128 and +127.

For color inputs in **hexadecimal** (e.g., `#FFF`) or **RGB** formats, see examples for other languages :

## Verification

[![C++ CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-cpp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-cpp.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

We generate 10 million color pairs using the [C version](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c), and verify the ŒîE2000 values computed by C++ :

1. `command -v g++ > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install g++ ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `g++ -std=c++14 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Ofast -o ciede-2000-test tests/cpp/ciede-2000-driver.cpp`
4. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
5. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
6. `./ciede-2000-test test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.cpp](ciede-2000-driver.cpp#L95) for calculations and [test-cpp.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-cpp.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors :

### Comparison with dvisvgm

[![ŒîE2000 against dvisvgm in C++](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-dvisvgm.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-dvisvgm.yml)

Compared to the well-maintained **dvisvgm** library  ‚Äî first released in 2007 and still widely used 18 years later ‚Äî this ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> function, checked on billions of random L\*a\*b\* color pairs, has an absolute deviation of no more than **5 √ó 10<sup>-13</sup>**. As before in [C99](../c#comparison-with-the-vmaf-c99-library), [JavaScript](../js#comparison-with-the-npmchroma-js-library), [Python](../py#comparison-with-the-python-colormath-library) and  [Rust](../rs#comparison-with-the-palette-library), this confirms the production-ready status of the `ciede_2000` function in C++, as well as its general interoperability.

> This formula, "small" in size, is an essential pillar of color management, deserving of this rigorous, tested and reliable industrial treatment.
