# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Haskell-powered.

Delta E 2000 is a worldwide standard for quantifying color differences, widely used in sectors such as printing and textiles.

This **Haskell** implementation provides a precise, easy-to-use function for calculating these CIE ŒîE<sub>00</sub> color differences programmatically.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code, last updated March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.hs#L6) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.hs).

## Example usage in Haskell

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```hs
-- Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Haskell

let (l1, a1, b1) = (46.9, 56.7, -2.5)
let (l2, a2, b2) = (46.6, 50.7, 2.3)

let deltaE = ciede_2000 l1 a1 b1 l2 a2 b2
print deltaE

-- .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 2.9263291321
-- As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 2.9263153756
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* generally between -128 and +127.

## Verification

[![Haskell CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-hs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-hs.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Haskell**, like this :

1. `command -v ghc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ghc cabal-install ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `cabal update && cabal install --lib split`
4. `ghc -Wall -Werror -package split -O2 -threaded -rtsopts -o test-ciede-2000 tests/hs/ciede-2000-driver.hs`
5. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
6. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
7. `./test-ciede-2000 test-cases.csv +RTS -N | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.hs](ciede-2000-driver.hs#L96) for calculations and [test-hs.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-hs.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
