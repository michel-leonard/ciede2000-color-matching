# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. TCL-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the globally recognized standard for quantifying color differences according to human vision.

This reference implementation in **Tool Command Language** offers a simple way of calculating these differences accurately within scripts.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code (released March 1, 2025) is available [here](../../ciede-2000.tcl#L6) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.tcl).

## Example usage in TCL

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```tcl
# Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in TCL

set color_1 { 77.6 32.2 2.3 }
set color_2 { 79.6 37.6 -2.2 }

lassign $color_1 l1 a1 b1
lassign $color_2 l2 a2 b2

set deltaE [ciede_2000  $l1 $a1 $b1 $l2 $a2 $b2]

puts "Delta E 2000 = $deltaE"

# .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 3.6681680203
# As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 3.6681547431
```

**Note** : L\* varies nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* most often between -128 and +127.

## Verification

[![TCL CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-tcl.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-tcl.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by TCL**, like this :

1. `command -v tclsh > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tcl ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
4. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
5. `tclsh tests/tcl/ciede-2000-driver.tcl test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.tcl](ciede-2000-driver.tcl#L91) for calculations and [test-tcl.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-tcl.yml) for automation.
