# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Ada-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the industry standard for quantifying color differences in accordance with how humans see them.

This reference implementation in **Ada** provides a simple, accurate and programmatic way of calculating these differences.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full Ada 2005 source code, released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.adb#L8) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.adb).

## Example usage in Ada

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```ada
-- Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Ada

-- Color 1: l1 = 28.9, a1 = 47.5, b1 = 2.0
-- Color 2: l2 = 28.8, a2 = 41.6, b2 = -1.7

deltaE := ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2);
Put(deltaE, Fore => 1, Aft => 15, Exp => 0);
New_Line;

-- .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 2.7749016764
-- As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 2.7749152801
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* generally between -128 and +127.

## Verification

[![Ada CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-adb.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-adb.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Ada**, like this :

1. `command -v gnatmake > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnat ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `cp -p tests/adb/ciede-2000-driver.adb main.adb`
4. `gnatmake main.adb -gnat05 -O3 -gnatwa -gnatf -gnatwd -gnatwe -gnatws -f -o driver-ada`
5. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
6. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 | sed -E 's/(,|^)([0-9+-]+)e([0-9+-]+)/\1\2.0e\3/gi' > test-cases.csv`
7. `./driver-ada test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.adb](ciede-2000-driver.adb#L108) for calculations and [test-adb.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-adb.yml) for automation.
