# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Zig-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the current industry standard for quantifying color differences in a way that best matches human vision.

This reference implementation in **Zig** offers a simple and reliable method for efficiently calculating color differences within software.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.zig#L9) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.zig).

This classic source code can be seamlessly integrated in both [C](../c#Œ¥e2000--accurate-fast-c-powered) and [C++](../cpp#Œ¥e2000--accurate-fast-c-powered) projects.

## Example usage in Zig

Calculate the **Delta E 2000** between two colors in the **L\*a\*b\*** color space using the `ciede_2000` function :

```zig
// Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Zig

const l1, const a1, const b1 = .{ 52.9, 33.7, -2.0 };
const l2, const a2, const b2 = .{ 53.5, 28.5, 1.9 };

const delta_e = ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2);
std.debug.print("{}\n", .{delta_e});

// .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 3.2925558212
// As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 3.2925418295
```

**Note** :
- L\* nominally ranges from 0 to 100
- a\* and b\* usually range from -128 to +127

For color inputs in **hexadecimal** (e.g., `#FFF`) or **RGB** formats, see examples for other languages :

## Verification

[![Zig CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-zig.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-zig.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Zig**, like this :

1.
```sh
if ! command -v zig > /dev/null; then
  # Select the most recent version of Zig
  ZIG_URL=$(wget --no-verbose --no-check-certificate --timeout=3 --tries=2 'https://ziglang.org/download/index.json' -O- |
    tr '"' '\n' | grep x86_64-linux | grep ^http | grep download | head -n 1)
  echo "The most recent URL to download Zig is $ZIG_URL"
  # Instead, use the Zig version for which the ŒîE2000 driver has been designed
  ZIG_URL='https://github.com/ifreund/zig-tarball-mirror/releases/download/0.15.1/zig-x86_64-linux-0.15.1.tar.xz'
  echo "The URL used to download Zig is $ZIG_URL"
  # Download and extract the Zig archive to an appropriate directory
  sudo rm -rf /opt/zig && mkdir /opt/zig
  wget --no-verbose --no-check-certificate --timeout=5 --tries=2 "$ZIG_URL" -O- | tar -C /opt/zig --strip-components=1 -xJf -
  # Add Zig to system PATH
  sudo ln --backup --symbolic --verbose /opt/zig/zig /usr/local/bin/zig
  # Congratulations, Zig was installed in less than 15 seconds !
fi
```
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
4. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
5. `zig run tests/zig/ciede-2000-driver.zig -O ReleaseFast --  test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.zig](ciede-2000-driver.zig#L93) for calculations and [test-zig.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-zig.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
