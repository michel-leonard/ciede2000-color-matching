# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Rust-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the classic 21st century standard for quantifying color differences in accordance with human vision.

This implementation in **Rust** provides a simple, accurate and efficient way of calculating these differences within programs.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code, released on March 1, 2025, is available in two precision variants :
- <ins>Precision</ins> : for rigorous scientific validations, a **64-bit double precision** version, which can be found [here](../../ciede-2000.rs#L6) and is archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.rs).
- <ins>Performance</ins> : for most practical applications, a generic version supporting **32-bit single precision** using [num-traits](https://crates.io/crates/num-traits) is available [in this file](ciede-2000-generic.rs#L18).

**Benchmark** : Single-precision (`f32`) calculations run approximately 1.5 to 1.7 times faster than double-precision (`f64`).

## Example usage in Rust

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```rust
// Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Rust

let (l1, a1, b1) = (22.4, 48.8, -3.7);
let (l2, a2, b2) = (23.2, 42.8, 4.0);

let delta_e = ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2);
println!("ŒîE2000: {}", delta_e);

// .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 4.5321090902
// As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 4.5320940436
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* usually between -128 and +127.

To compare **hexadecimal** (e.g., "#FFF") or **RGB colors** using the CIEDE2000 function, see these examples :

- [compare-rgb-colors.rs](compare-rgb-colors.rs#L198)

## Verification

[![Rust CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-rs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-rs.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Rust**, like this :

1.
```sh
command -v cargo > /dev/null || {
  wget --no-verbose --no-check-certificate --timeout=5 --tries=2 "https://sh.rustup.rs" -O- |
  sh -s -- --no-modify-path --profile minimal
  for file in $HOME/.cargo/bin/*; do
    # Create symbolic links that integrate Rust into the system PATH
    sudo ln --backup --symbolic --verbose "$(readlink -f "$file")" "/usr/local/bin/${file##*/}"
  done
}
```
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `cargo new demo`
4. `cp -p tests/rs/ciede-2000-driver.rs demo/src/main.rs`
5. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
6. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
7. `cargo run --manifest-path=demo/Cargo.toml --release -- test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.rs](ciede-2000-driver.rs#L92) for calculations and [test-rs.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-rs.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :

### Comparison with the palette Library

[![ŒîE2000 against palette in Rust](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-palette.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-palette.yml)

Compared to the widely used Rust crate **palette** ‚Äî first released in 2015 and still actively maintained 10 years later ‚Äî this generic ŒîE<sub>00</sub> formula implementation has been validated on billions of random L\*a\*b\* color pairs. The absolute deviation observed never exceeds **5‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10<sup>-13</sup>**, which, as earlier in [C99](../c#comparison-with-the-vmaf-c99-library), [Java](../java#comparison-with-the-openimaj), [JavaScript](../js/README.markdown#comparison-with-the-npmchroma-js-library) and [Python](../py#comparison-with-the-python-colormath-library), confirms that the `ciede_2000` function has a **production-ready** status in the Rust ecosystem.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To correct this Rust source code to exact match certain third-party ŒîE2000 functions, follow the comments in the source code.

> This formula, "small" in size, is an essential pillar of color management, deserving of this rigorous, tested and reliable industrial treatment.
