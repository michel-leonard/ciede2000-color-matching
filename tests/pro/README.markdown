# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Prolog-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the globally recognized standard for quantifying color differences according to human vision.

This reference implementation in **Prolog** offers a simple way of calculating these differences accurately within programs.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code (released March 1, 2025) is available [here](../../ciede-2000.pro#L6) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.pro).

## Example usage in Prolog

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```prolog
% Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Prolog

color_1([69.5, 43.6, -1.8]).
color_2([70.2, 37.9, 1.6]).

extract_lab([L, A, B], L, A, B).

compute_delta_e :-
	color_1(C1),
	color_2(C2),
	extract_lab(C1, L1, A1, B1),
	extract_lab(C2, L2, A2, B2),
	ciede_2000(L1, A1, B1, L2, A2, B2, DeltaE),
	format('Delta E 2000 = ~10f~n', [DeltaE]).

% .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 2.8044781137
% As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 2.8044649638
```

**Note** : L\* varies nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* most often between -128 and +127.

## Verification

[![Prolog CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-pro.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-pro.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Prolog**, like this :

1. `command -v swipl > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install swi-prolog ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
4. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
5. `swipl -q -s tests/pro/ciede-2000-driver.pro -- test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.pro](ciede-2000-driver.pro#L139) for calculations and [test-pro.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-pro.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
