# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Haxe-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the globally adopted standard for reliably measuring perceptual color differences.

This reference implementation in **Haxe** makes it easy to calculate these differences accurately in code.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code (released March 1, 2025) is available in the [main Haxe implementation](../../ciede-2000.hx#L9) and archived for reference [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.hx).

[JavaScript](../js#Œ¥e2000--accurate-fast-javascript-powered), [Python](../py#Œ¥e2000--accurate-fast-python-powered), [Java](../java#Œ¥e2000--accurate-fast-java-powered) can all seamlessly integrate this classic source code.

## Example usage in Haxe

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```hx
// Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Haxe

// Color 1: l1 = 64.9   a1 = 12.6   b1 = 3.0
// Color 2: l2 = 66.8   a2 = 18.3   b2 = -4.3

var deltaE: Float = ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2);
trace(deltaE);

// .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 6.6360262302
// As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 6.6360100975
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* usually between -128 and +127.

## Verification

[![Haxe CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-hx.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-hx.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Haxe**, like this :

1.

```sh
command -v haxe > /dev/null || {
  # 1. Select the version of Haxe you wish to install (Haxe 4 and Haxe 5 both work),
  # the list of available versions is located at https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/releases
  HAXE_DESIRED_VERSION="5.0.0-preview.1"
  HAXE_DESIRED_VERSION="4.3.7"
  # 2. Download the archive and place it in a suitable directory
  sudo rm -rf "/opt/haxe-$HAXE_DESIRED_VERSION" && mkdir "/opt/haxe-$HAXE_DESIRED_VERSION"
  HAXE_ARCHIVE_URL="https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/releases/download"
  HAXE_ARCHIVE_URL="$HAXE_ARCHIVE_URL/$HAXE_DESIRED_VERSION/haxe-$HAXE_DESIRED_VERSION-linux64.tar.gz"
  wget --quiet --no-check-certificate --timeout=5 --tries=2 "$HAXE_ARCHIVE_URL" -O- |
  tar -xz --strip-components=1 -C "/opt/haxe-$HAXE_DESIRED_VERSION"
  # 3. Create a symbolic link that integrates Haxe into the PATH
  sudo ln --backup --symbolic --verbose "/opt/haxe-$HAXE_DESIRED_VERSION/haxe" /usr/local/bin/haxe
}
```

2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `cp -p tests/hx/ciede-2000-driver.hx tests/hx/Main.hx`
4. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
5. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
6. `haxe -cp tests/hx --run Main test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.hx](ciede-2000-driver.hx#L93) for calculations and [test-hx.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-hx.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
