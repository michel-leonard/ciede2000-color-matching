# ΔE2000 — Accurate. Fast. Racket-powered.

ΔE2000 is the globally accepted standard for quantifying color differences in a way that best matches human vision.

This reference implementation in **Racket** offers an easy way to calculate these differences accurately within programs.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, 🔵 navy blue and 🟡 yellow, which are very different colors, have a ΔE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.rkt#L8) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.rkt).

<details>
<summary>What two options are available for matching ΔE2000 calculations with existing calculations ?</summary>

#### Option 1 (default)
 This often-used option consists of a coding simplification that is a historical legacy of early implementations :
```racket
(set! h_m (+ h_m pi)))
; (if (< h_m pi) (set! h_m (+ h_m pi)) (set! h_m (- h_m pi))))
```

#### Option 2 (compatible with Gaurav Sharma’s precise calculations)
There’s no room for ambiguity, this inversion of the commented line in the source code ensures compliance with the official :
```racket
; (set! h_m (+ h_m pi)))
(if (< h_m pi) (set! h_m (+ h_m pi)) (set! h_m (- h_m pi))))
```

**Note** : the difference between the two options is minimal (±0.0003 on the calculated color difference) and usually overlooked.

## Example usage in Racket

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```racket
; Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Racket

; Color 1: l1 = 11.0   a1 = 17.2   b1 = 3.4
; Color 2: l2 = 12.3   a2 = 22.6   b2 = -4.2

(define delta-e (ciede_2000 l1 a1 b1 l2 a2 b2))
(displayln delta-e)

; .................................................. This shows a ΔE2000 of 6.0137922953
; As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 6.0137736278
```

**Note** : Here, `L*` nominally ranges from 0 to 100, while `a*` and `b*` values are generally between -128 and 127.

## Verification

[![Racket CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-rkt.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-rkt.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Racket**, like this :

1. `command -v racket > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install racket ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
4. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
5. `racket tests/rkt/ciede-2000-driver.rkt test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.rk](ciede-2000-driver.rk) for calculations and [test-rk.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-rk.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
