# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Pascal-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the current standard for quantifying color differences in a way that best matches human vision.

This reference implementation in **Pascal** makes it possible to set up precise, programmatic color comparison right now.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.pas#L9) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.pas).

Object Pascal (Delphi) can seamlessly integrate this classic source code.

## Example usage in Pascal

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```pas
// Calculate ŒîE*00 between two colors in L*a*b* space
var
  l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2, deltaE: Double;
begin
  l1 := 31.8; a1 := 22.9; b1 := 4.8;
  l2 := 30.2; a2 := 18.7; b2 := -3.7;

  deltaE := ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2);
  writeln('CIEDE2000 = ', deltaE:0:10);
end.

// .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 6.1884550095
// As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 6.1884708040
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* usually between -128 and +127.

## Verification

[![Pascal CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-pas.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-pas.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Pascal**, like this :

1. `command -v fp-compiler > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install fp-compiler ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `fpc -O2 -oCIEDE2000Test tests/pas/ciede-2000-driver.pas`
4. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
5. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
6. `tests/pas/CIEDE2000Test test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.pas](ciede-2000-driver.pas#L99) for calculations and [test-pas.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-pas.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
