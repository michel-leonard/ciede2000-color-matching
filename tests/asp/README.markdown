# ΔE2000 — Accurate. Fast. ASP-powered.

ΔE2000 is the current standard for comparing colors in a way that best matches human perception.

This reference implementation in **VBScript** offers a simple and accurate way of calculating these color differences in traditional workflows.

## Overview

This algorithm provides scientifically rigorous color similarity (or difference) calculations on IIS servers.

As a general rule, 🔵 navy blue and 🟡 yellow, which are very different colors, have a ΔE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full **ASP Classic** source code released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.asp#L10) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.asp).

## Example usage in ASP

A typical **Delta E 2000** computation between two colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```vbscript
' Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in ASP

' Color 1: L1 = 28.9, a1 = 47.5, b1 = 2.0
' Color 2: L2 = 28.8, a2 = 41.6, b2 = -1.7

Dim deltaE
deltaE = ciede_2000(L1, a1, b1, L2, a2, b2)
Response.Write "ΔE2000 = " & deltaE

' .................................................. This shows a ΔE2000 of 2.7749016764
' As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 2.7749152801
```

**Note** : L\* usually ranges from 0 to 100, while a\* and b\* typically range from –128 to +127.

## Verification

[![ASP CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-asp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-asp.yml)

ASP Classic, unlike other programming languages, doesn't have its own test driver. The [VBA driver](../bas/ciede-2000-driver.bas) is used for tests, and only the VBScript ΔE2000 function is injected inside, using the steam editor (`sed`), to replace the VBA function. The file [test-asp.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-asp.yml) is used for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
