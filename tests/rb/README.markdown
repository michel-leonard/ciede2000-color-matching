# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Ruby-powered.

ŒîE2000 is used worldwide as the most accurate standard for evaluating color differences.

This reference **Ruby** implementation provides a simple and accurate way of calculating these differences within programs.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.rb#L6) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.rb).

## Example usage in Ruby

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```ruby
# Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Ruby

# Color 1: l1 = 62.6   a1 = 19.4   b1 = -1.8
# Color 2: l2 = 62.5   a2 = 24.5   b2 = 3.3

delta_e = ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2)
puts delta_e

# .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 4.3323552676
# As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 4.3323684016
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* typically between -128 and +127.

To compare **hexadecimal** (e.g., "#FFF") or **RGB colors** using the CIEDE2000 function, follow these examples :
- [compare-hex-colors.rb](compare-hex-colors.rb#L191)
- [compare-rgb-colors.rb](compare-rgb-colors.rb#L191)

## Verification

[![Ruby CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-rb.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-rb.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Ruby**, like this :

1. `command -v ruby > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ruby ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
4. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
5. `ruby --yjit tests/rb/ciede-2000-driver.rb test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.rb](ciede-2000-driver.rb#L86) for calculations and [test-rb.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-rb.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, showing no errors :

### Comparison with the Gem colorscore in Ruby

[![ŒîE2000 against colorscore in Ruby](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-colorscore.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/vs-colorscore.yml)

Compared with the well-maintained **colorscore** gem ‚Äî first released in 2016 and still widely used 9 years later ‚Äî this implementation of the CIE ŒîE*<sub>00</sub> color difference formula, tested on millions of color pairs, shows an absolute deviation of no more than **4‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10<sup>-13</sup>**. This ‚ÄØneglieable difference argues in favor of the interoperability of this `ciede_2000` function, in Ruby as in other programming languages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To correct this Ruby source code to exact match certain third-party ŒîE2000 functions, follow the comments in the source code.

> This formula, "small" in size, is an essential pillar of color management, deserving of this rigorous, tested and reliable industrial treatment.
