# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Go-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the current industry standard for quantifying color differences in a manner consistent with human vision.

This reference implementation in **Go** offers a simple, accurate and programmatic way of calculating these differences.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.go#L10) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.go).

## Example usage in Go

Here is an example of calculating the ŒîE<sub>00</sub> difference between two colors in the L\*a\*b\* color space using the `ciede_2000` function :

```go
// Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Go
// Color 1: l1 = 90.3   a1 = 38.2   b1 = -2.1
// Color 2: l2 = 89.9   a2 = 43.9   b2 = 2.6

deltaE := ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2)
fmt.Printf("%f\n", deltaE)

// .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 3.2738672431
// As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 3.2738822974
```

**Note** : The L\* value nominally ranges from 0 to 100, while a\* and b\* values range usually from -128 to +127.

## Verification

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Go**, like this :

1. `command -v go > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install go ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
4. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
5. `go run tests/go/ciede-2000-driver.go test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.go](ciede-2000-driver.go#L101) for calculations and [raw-dart.go](../../.github/workflows/test-go.yml) for automation.

Test results confirm full compliance with the standard, with no errors and negligible floating-point deviation :

Compared to the Go package **go-chromath** ‚Äî this implementation of the ŒîE2000 color difference formula, verified over 100 million color pair comparisons, exhibits a deviation of no more than **2‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10<sup>-13</sup>**. This confirms that the `ciede_2000` function is suitable for general use in Go.

### Comparison with the xterm-color-chart Library
