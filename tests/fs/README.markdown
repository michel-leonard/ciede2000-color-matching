# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. F#-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the current standard for quantifying color differences in a way that best matches human vision.

This reference implementation in **F#** provides a simple method for calculating these color differences within programs.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full F# source code (released March 1, 2025) is available [here](../../ciede-2000.fs#L8) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.fs).

This classic source code can be seamlessly integrated into [C#](../cs#Œ¥e2000--accurate-fast-c-powered), VB.NET, and PowerShell projects.

## Example usage in F#

To calculate the **Delta E 2000** difference between two colors specified in the **L\*a\*b\*** color space, use the `ciede_2000` function :
```fs
// Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in F#

let l1, a1, b1 = 3.9, 16.9, -4.9
let l2, a2, b2 = 3.1, 11.8, 3.6

let deltaE = ciede_2000 l1 a1 b1 l2 a2 b2
printfn "%f" deltaE

// .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 7.0799401968
// As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 7.0799265161
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* usually between -128 and +127.

For color inputs in **hexadecimal** (e.g., `#FFF`) or **RGB** formats, see examples for other languages :

## Verification

[![F# CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-fs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-fs.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by F#**, like this :

1. `command -v dotnet > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-8.0 ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `mkdir -p ciede-2000-tests/Exec`
4. `dotnet new console -lang "F#" -n Exec -o ciede-2000-tests/Exec`
5. `cp -p tests/fs/ciede-2000-driver.fs ciede-2000-tests/Exec/Program.fs`
6.
 ```sh
printf '%s\n' '<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">' \
'  <PropertyGroup>' \
'    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>' \
'    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>' \
'    <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>' \
'  </PropertyGroup>' \
'  <ItemGroup>' \
'    <Compile Include="Program.fs" />' \
'  </ItemGroup>' \
'</Project>' > ciede-2000-tests/Exec/Exec.fsproj
```
7. `dotnet build --configuration Release ciede-2000-tests/Exec`
8. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
9. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
10. `dotnet run --configuration Release --project ciede-2000-tests/Exec -- test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.fs](ciede-2000-driver.fs#L89) for calculations and [test-fs.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-fs.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
