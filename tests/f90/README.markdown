# ΔE2000 — Accurate. Fast. Fortran-powered.

ΔE2000 is the current standard for quantifying color differences in a way that best matches human vision.

This reference **Fortran** implementation offers an easy way to calculate these differences accurately and programmatically.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, 🔵 navy blue and 🟡 yellow, which are very different colors, have a ΔE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code, compatible with Fortran 2008 and 2018 standards, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.f90#L16) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.f90).

**Speed** : For ΔE*<sub>00</sub> calculations in 32-bit rather than 64-bit, simply replace `real64` with `real32` in the source code, this is often [sufficient](../../#numerical-precision-32-bit-vs-64-bit).

<details>
<summary>What two options are available for matching ΔE2000 calculations with existing calculations ?</summary>

#### Option 1 (default)
 This often-used option consists of a coding simplification that is a historical legacy of early implementations :
```f90
h_m = h_m + M_PI
! h_m = h_m + MERGE(M_PI, -M_PI, h_m < M_PI)
```

#### Option 2 (compatible with Gaurav Sharma’s precise calculations)
There’s no room for ambiguity, this inversion of the commented line in the source code ensures compliance with the official :
```f90
! h_m = h_m + M_PI
h_m = h_m + MERGE(M_PI, -M_PI, h_m < M_PI)
```

**Note** : the difference between the two options is minimal (±0.0003 on the calculated color difference) and usually overlooked.

## Example usage in Fortran

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```f90
! Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Fortran

! Color 1: l1 = 89.0   a1 = 33.3   b1 = -1.7
! Color 2: l2 = 89.2   a2 = 38.4   b2 = 2.2

delta_e = ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2)
print '(F0.10)', delta_e

! .................................................. This shows a ΔE2000 of 2.9929564263
! As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 2.9929700654
```
**Note** :
- L\* values nominally range from 0 to 100
- a\* and b\* values usually range from -128 to +127

## Verification

[![Fortran CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-f90.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-f90.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Fortran**, like this :

1. `command -v gfortran > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gfortran ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gfortran-14 -std=f2008 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -O3 -o ciede-2000-test tests/f90/ciede-2000-driver.f90`
4. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
5. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
6. `./ciede-2000-test test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.f90](ciede-2000-driver.f90#L97) for calculations and [test-f90.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-f90.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
