# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Fortran-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the current standard for quantifying color differences in a way that best matches human vision.

This reference **Fortran** implementation offers an easy way to calculate these differences accurately and programmatically.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code, compatible with Fortran 2008 and 2018 standards, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.f90#L16) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.f90).

## Example usage in Fortran

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```f90
! Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Fortran

! Color 1: l1 = 89.0   a1 = 33.3   b1 = -1.7
! Color 2: l2 = 89.2   a2 = 38.4   b2 = 2.2

delta_e = ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2)
print '(F15.10)', delta_e

! .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 2.9929564263
! As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 2.9929700654
```
**Note** :
- L\* values nominally range from 0 to 100
- a\* and b\* values usually range from -128 to +127

## Verification

[![Fortran CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-f90.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-f90.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by Fortran**, like this :

1. `command -v gfortran > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gfortran ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gfortran-14 -std=f2008 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -O3 -o ciede-2000-test tests/f90/ciede-2000-driver.f90`
4. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
5. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
6. `./ciede-2000-test test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.f90](ciede-2000-driver.f90#L97) for calculations and [test-f90.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-f90.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
