# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. Elixir-powered.

ŒîE2000 is the modern standard for quantifying color differences with high accuracy, now interoperable with Erlang.

This reference **Elixir** implementation offers a way of calculating these differences reliably within programs.

## Overview

The algorithm developed in BEAM-native measures color similarity (or difference) with scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.exs#L6) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.exs).

## Example usage in Elixir

```exs
# Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in Elixir

{ l1, a1, b1 } = { 57.1, 17.1, 4.9  }
{ l2, a2, b2 } = { 59.2, 10.9, -3.1 }

delta_e = ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2)
IO.puts("#{delta_e}")

# .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 7.5254510508
# As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 7.5254660817
```

**Note** : L\* usually ranges from 0 to 100, while a\* and b\* typically range from ‚Äì128 to +127.

## Verification

[![Elixir CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-exs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-exs.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates random color pairs, and checks the Delta E 2000 color differences produced in Elixir, like this :
1.

```sh
command -v elixir > /dev/null || {
  # 1. Download and install the latest versions of Elixir and OTP (started with Elixir 1.18.4 and OTP 27.3.4)
  wget --quiet --no-check-certificate --timeout=5 --tries=3 https://elixir-lang.org/install.sh -O- | sh -s -- elixir@latest otp@latest
  # 2. Add installed directories to the PATH
  for DIRECTORY in $HOME/.elixir-install/installs/*/*/bin; do
    LINE="export PATH=\"$PATH:$DIRECTORY\""
    echo "$LINE" >> $HOME/.profile    # For future sessions
    eval "$LINE"                      # For the current session
  done
  # 3. Display current versions of Elixir and OTP
  elixir --version
}
```

2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
4. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
5. `elixir tests/exs/ciede-2000-driver.exs test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.exs](ciede-2000-driver.exs#L87) for calculations and [test-exs.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-exs.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
