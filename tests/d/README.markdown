# ŒîE2000 ‚Äî Accurate. Fast. D-powered.

To calculate color differences precisely using the CIEDE2000 formula, this is efficiently implemented in the **D** programming language.

## Overview

The developed algorithm enables software to evaluate color similarities (or differences) with native performance and scientific rigor.

As a general rule, üîµ navy blue and üü° yellow, which are very different colors, have a ŒîE\*<sub>00</sub> of around 115.

Values [such as 5](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/de2000-rgb-pairs.html?seq=50&delta-e=5) indicate greater closeness, making this both a simple and advanced method of color comparison.

## Implementation Details

The full source code released on March 1, 2025, is available [here](../../ciede-2000.d#L8) and archived [here](https://web.archive.org/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/refs/heads/main/ciede-2000.d).

A **templated** ŒîE<sub>00</sub> function is available [here](ciede-2000-generic.d#L19), which supports both **32-bit** single-precision and **64-bit** double-precision computations.

## Example usage in D

The typical calculation of the **Delta E 2000** between 2 colors in the **L\*a\*b\* color space** is done using the `ciede_2000` function :

```d
// Compute the Delta E (CIEDE2000) color difference between two L*a*b* colors in D

// Color 1: l1 = 26.8   a1 = 41.6   b1 = -3.4
// Color 2: l2 = 24.9   a2 = 47.4   b2 = 5.2

double deltaE = ciede_2000(l1, a1, b1, l2, a2, b2);
writeln(format("%.12f", deltaE));

// .................................................. This shows a ŒîE2000 of 5.1279872048
// As explained in the comments, compliance with Gaurav Sharma would display 5.1280011106
```

**Note** : L\* is nominally between 0 and 100, a\* and b\* generally between -128 and +127.

## Verification

[![D CIEDE2000 Testing](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-d.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/actions/workflows/test-d.yml)

<details>
<summary>What is the testing procedure ?</summary>

The [ciede-2000-driver.c](../c/ciede-2000-driver.c) program generates color pairs, and checks the **CIE2000** color differences **measured by D**, like this :

1. `command -v ldc2 > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ldc ; }`
2. `command -v gcc > /dev/null || { sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc ; }`
3. `cp -p tests/d/ciede-2000-driver.d tests/d/main.d`
4. `ldc2 -O -release -boundscheck=off -of=ciede2000-test tests/d/main.d`
5. `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -O2 -g tests/c/ciede-2000-driver.c -o ciede-2000-driver -lm`
6. `./ciede-2000-driver --generate 10000000 --output-file test-cases.csv`
7. `./ciede2000-test test-cases.csv | ./ciede-2000-driver`

Where the main files involved are [ciede-2000-driver.d](ciede-2000-driver.d#L90) for calculations and [test-d.yml](../../.github/workflows/test-d.yml) for automation.

The test confirms full compliance with the standard, with no observed errors and a negligible maximum floating-point deviation :
