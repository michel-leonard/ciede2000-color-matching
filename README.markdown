## Version

This document describes the CIE ΔE2000 v1.0.0 functions, all accurate to 10 decimal places, released in March 2025.

![Diagram of the CIEDE2000 formula showing Lab components and adjustments](https://github.com/michel-leonard/ciede2000-color-matching/raw/main/docs/assets/images/formula.jpg)

**Overview** : The formula is an internationally recognized measure for comparing two colors in the CIELAB color space. It improves on its CIE94 predecessor by incorporating new adjustments, enabling more accurate color comparisons.

**Purpose** : The ΔE<sub>00</sub> algorithm, which is notorious for exhibiting discontinuities, is designed to reflect the difficulty of distinguishing between two colors, rather than being a locally smooth and uniform Euclidean metric.

**Nomenclature** : The terms CIE2000, CIEDE2000, ΔE<sub>00</sub>, ΔE\*<sub>00</sub>, and ΔE2000 are used interchangeably in this repository.

## Implementations

Engineered for precision and portability, this **reference** implementation of the **DeltaE 2000** formula achieves color difference calculations without dependencies, and supports a wide range of programming languages :

**Quality Assurance** : These implementations are validated to an accuracy of 10<sup>-10</sup> against calculations performed by Netflix’s Emmy Awarded **VMAF library** and the trusted **npm/chroma-js**, calculations performed by **Fogra** (a reputed institution in the graphics and printing industry), and, for example, also with the **California Institute of Technology**’s ΔE00 calculations — guaranteeing their [scientific](tests/m#comparison-with-wagenaarlab) rigor and [practical](tests/c#comparison-with-the-vmaf-c99-library) reliability in the face of the zero errors observed.

**Note** : Each source contains the definition of the two main variants (both correct in practice) of the ΔE\*<sub>00</sub> algorithm. For example, OpenJDK uses a function named `cie00`, which corresponds to the line currently commented on.

<details>
<summary>Explain precisely what differs in the source code between the two main variants !</summary>

Online, we can see a live difference of [±0.0002](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/lab-color-calculator.html?L1=34.6&a1=1.4&b1=-12.5&L2=36.4&a2=13.8&b2=123.6) in the ΔE2000 between the two variants. Turning to the technical side, the modification, here in Java language, to switch from one variant of the ΔE\*<sub>00</sub> algorithm to the other is as follows.

#### Syntax for switching between variants

```diff
- h_m += Math.PI;                                // Bruce Lindbloom, Netflix’s VMAF, ...
+ h_m += h_m < Math.PI ? Math.PI : -Math.PI;     // Gaurav Sharma, OpenJDK, ...
```

✅ Applying this predefined modification results in ΔE2000 compliance with Gaurav Sharma with a tolerance of **10<sup>-12</sup>**.

> The current variant is suitable for production workflows, the other one is clearer for metrological applications. Historically, these two variants are the result of a coding simplification inherited from the first implementations. The choice to prefer one over the other depends on the desired interoperability, but they differ by only ±0.0003 (same as the typical 32-bit float precision), which underlines the sufficiency of the 32-bit `ciede_2000` functions.

```

For reference, the biggest color difference between lime green (#9f0) and dark navy (#006) yields a ΔE<sub>00</sub> value of 119. Lower values indicate more similar colors, making it easy to determine the closest match to a given color.

### Use Cases

## Testing and Validation

To ensure accurate color evaluation, [extensive tests](tests#ciede-2000-function-test) involving hundreds of billions of colors were carried out, including precise comparisons with major libraries. The consistency of the ΔE*<sub>00</sub> function across languages is fundamental here.

- **Test cases** : Each programming language was tested on hundreds of millions of L\*a\*b\* color pairs.
- **Tolerance** : All programming languages are capable of producing the correct results with a tolerance of `1e-10`.
- **Workflow** : All programming languages have their own dedicated test involving 20M new colors every month.

> In summary, the absolute value of the deviation in ΔE2000 between two implementations never exceeds 10<sup>-10</sup>.

**Correctness** : Today, the world’s leading companies rely on the CIE2000 formula, and are encouraged, along with software developers, to carry out tests that reveal the inconsistencies between different implementations.

### Numerical Stability in CIEDE2000

To confirm its exceptional accuracy, the JavaScript implementation was subjected to an endurance test against an old and reliable reference. No deviation greater than **10<sup>-12</sup>** was detected in ΔE00s over the **80,000,000,000,000** random color pairs tested. Minor differences were attributed to degree-to-radian conversions in the reference calculations.

#### Angle Conversions

> Finally, you've here the right implementation of ΔE2000, which completely eliminates degree/radian conversions.

The professional approach in software is to use radians for mathematical calculations, as angle conversions, while theoretically valid, result in a loss of precision due to rounding errors in floating-point numbers. Here, only radians are used, without conversion, but this can be a source of inconsistency for an external implementation.

For example, we rely on `value > π` in radians, which is the same as `value > 180` in degrees. Due to conversions, an implementation [using degrees](http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?ColorDifferenceCalc.html) may obtain `180.00000000000003`, while its equivalent [in radians](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/lab-color-calculator.html?L1=88&a1=-124&b1=56&L2=97&a2=62&b2=-28) would have given exactly `π = 3.141592653589793`, leading to different [branching](ciede-2000.js#L32) and discrepancies in the calculated ΔE CIE2000.

#### Angle Computations

In most environments, when **a\*** and **b\*** are both zero, `atan2(0, 0)` correctly evaluates to `0`, following mathematical convention, as in [JavaScript](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/lab-color-calculator.html?L1=1&a1=0&b1=0&L2=2&a2=0&b2=0). However, some programming languages may instead throw an exception or return `NaN` or `NULL`, and so patches are [in place](ciede-2000.sql#L30) to ensure totally reliable implementations. In addition, during automated tests, the C driver generates cases that confirm in each programming language that, although the result of `atan2(0, 0)` differs from that of `atan2(0, -0)`, this has no influence on the final CIE ΔE\*<sub>00</sub> color difference.

These discontinuities occur when the `a1 / b1` equals `a2 / b2` and the signs of `a1` and `a2` are opposite, then an infinitesimal variation in these components can produce a large variation in ΔE2000, as can be seen in the links.

#### IEEE 754 floating-point Limitations

Minor discrepancies can arise between programming languages, for instance, `atan2(-49.2, -34.9)` evaluates to `-2.1877696633888672` in Python and `-2.1877696633888677` in JavaScript, while `-2.187769663388867475...` is correct. Here, tolerated deviation for a cross-language exact color match is set to `1e-10`, linking sufficiency and achievability.

#### Numerical Precision: 32-bit vs 64-bit

The formula ΔE2000 involves numerically sensitive calculations, particularly those related to angles and  π. In 32-bit floating point, the rounding at each step can, when comparing two implementations, cause the conditional logic to move to a different branch of execution. Once in a different branch, the result may diverge, but this is more a natural consequence of the formula’s structure than a bug. These are not really errors, but rather expected discrepancies due to precision limits, which occur under specific conditions that are not usually encountered.

##### Use the `ciede_2000` function in 32-bit rather than 64-bit

The original functions favor 64-bit precision, but 32-bit functions, which are also available, can give virtually identical results to 64-bit, while being faster with a lighter footprint. Let's look at this with randomly generated L\*a\*b\* values rounded to the nearest tenth (otherwise no "rare" deviation is noticed even when doing it with many more colors).

| Condition | Common deviation (most cases) | Rare deviation (1 in ≥1M cases) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `ΔE2000 < 5` | 0.00005 | 0.02 |
| `ΔE2000 < 10` | 0.00005 | 0.07 |
| `ΔE2000 < 15` | 0.00005 | 0.3 |
| `ΔE2000 < 20` | 0.00005 | 2.3 |
| `ΔE2000 < 40` | 0.00005 | 9.0 |

The exact conditions for triggering a "rare" deviation between 32 and 64 bits are unlikely to occur naturally, and are improbable in real data streams from sensors or color space conversions. This experiment, based on 100,000,000 color pairs meeting the condition, showed that 32-bit `ciede_2000` functions are suitable for serious applications.

#### Debugging

Rounding L\*a\*b\* components and ΔE 2000 to [4 decimal places](tests#roundings) can be a solution for realistic color comparisons.

### Methodology

To ensure consistency across implementations, please follow these guidelines :
1. **Base your implementation** on an existing one, copy-pasting and adapting is encouraged.
2. **Validate correctness** basically using the [discovery generator](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching/discovery-generator.html), and formally using the [large-scale generator](https://michel-leonard.github.io/ciede2000-color-matching) :
   - Generate 1,000,000 samples, or 10,000 if you encounter technical limitations.
   - Verify that the computed ΔE 2000 values do not deviate by more than **1e-10** from reference values.
3. **Submit a pull request** with your implementation.

To enhance your contribution, consider writing documentation, as done for other programming languages. Your source code, along with the others, will then be reviewed and made available in this public domain repository.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `atan2` function is not available to you, a polyfill is provided in the [bc](ciede-2000.bc#L28) version.
